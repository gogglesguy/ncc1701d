ST:TNG Interactive Technical Manual

At the moment this is a QTVR viewer for the different VR rooms contained in the ST:TNG Interactive Technical Manual CDROM.

It makes use of the original data files, hence you'll need to have the original CDROM.

All the different VRs are contained in the ncc1701d subdirectory and are named like

  ncc1701d/XX/XX___nav.mov

So for example to load the Bridge, run the program with:

src/ncc1701d ncc1701d/04/04___nav.mov

Use the left mouse to rotate the scene and use the right mouse button switch to different viewpoints.
